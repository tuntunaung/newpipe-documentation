# NewPipe Documentation Project

This repository contains my individual project for the **Basics of Writing Software and API Documentation** course.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to plan, write, and structure high-quality technical documentation using GitHub Wiki and Swagger.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project documents **NewPipe**, an open-source Android application that provides a lightweight, privacy-friendly alternative for streaming video content.  
The documentation includes:

- A structured information architecture  
- Clear and concise user instructions  
- Visuals (screenshots and diagrams)  
- Concept, task, and reference topics  
- API documentation created using Swagger (two endpoints)  

All documentation is written in English and designed for a general end-user audience.

## 🌐 API Documentation (Swagger)

As part of the project, I designed a sample API named **NewPipe Library API**, including:

- `GET /videos/search`
- `POST /playlists`

The API is documented using Swagger and follows the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

You can view the API documentation here:  
👉 **Swagger Link:** *<add your SwaggerHub public link here>*

Screenshots and diagrams used in the documentation are stored under the repository’s **Code** section and referenced inside the Wiki pages.
